# RoadShare: Car-as-a-Node Explorer ðŸš—ðŸ’°

## Overview

RoadShare is a mobile application that demonstrates the potential of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) for vehicle data. The app allows users to visualize what their car is emitting in real-timeâ€”including speed, GPS location, fuel levels, and diagnostic informationâ€”while simulating potential earnings for sharing this valuable data.

Built for the DeCharge Network's DePIN for Car Data hackathon challenge, RoadShare aims to create a transparent ecosystem where vehicle owners can monetize their car's data while maintaining control over what is shared.

## Problem Statement

Vehicles generate massive amounts of valuable data that currently benefits only manufacturers and service providers. RoadShare addresses this imbalance by:

1. Giving car owners visibility into the data their vehicles generate
2. Providing a simulation of how this data could be monetized
3. Creating a framework for secure, permissioned data sharing
4. Building a foundation for a decentralized vehicle data marketplace

## Features

- **Real-time Data Visualization**: View your vehicle's speed, RPM, fuel level, engine temperature, and other metrics in real-time
- **Earnings Simulation**: See potential earnings from sharing different types of vehicle data
- **Location Tracking**: Visualize your routes and location data on an interactive map
- **Diagnostic Information**: View and understand diagnostic trouble codes from your vehicle
- **Data Sharing Controls**: Choose what data to share and when to share it
- **Earnings Dashboard**: Track simulated earnings with detailed breakdowns and projections

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **Data Visualization**: React Native Chart Kit
- **Maps**: React Native Maps
- **Blockchain Integration**: Para Wallet for potential token transactions
- **Location Services**: Expo Location

## Project Structure

- `/app`: Core application components and navigation
- `/assets`: Images, icons, and other static assets
- `/components`: Reusable UI components
- `/constants`: Application constants and configuration
- `/context`: React context providers for state management
- `/hooks`: Custom React hooks
- `/screens`: Main application screens
- `/utils`: Utility functions and helpers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI
- Android Studio (for Android development) or Xcode (for iOS development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kshitij-hash/RoadShare.git
cd RoadShare
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server

```bash
npx expo start
```

4. Run on a device or emulator
   - Press `a` for Android
   - Press `i` for iOS

## How It Works

1. **Connect**: The app simulates connecting to your vehicle's OBD-II port (in a real implementation, this would use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi)
2. **Visualize**: See your vehicle's data displayed in real-time on the dashboard
3. **Share**: Toggle data sharing on/off to simulate sharing vehicle data with the network
4. **Earn**: Watch as simulated earnings accumulate based on the value of the data shared

## Data Monetization Model

RoadShare implements a simulated monetization model where different types of vehicle data have varying values:

- **Base Rate**: $0.001 per data point
- **Speed Bonus**: +$0.0005 for speeds over 60km/h
- **Diagnostic Bonus**: +$0.002 for diagnostic trouble codes
- **Temperature Bonus**: +$0.001 for extreme engine temperatures
- **Market Fluctuation**: Â±$0.0005 random market variation

In a production environment, this would connect to a blockchain network for actual token rewards.

## Future Development

- Integration with actual OBD-II hardware for real vehicle data
- Blockchain implementation for secure, verifiable data transactions
- Marketplace for data consumers to bid on specific types of vehicle data
- Advanced privacy controls and data anonymization options
- Community features for comparing earnings and optimizing data sharing
